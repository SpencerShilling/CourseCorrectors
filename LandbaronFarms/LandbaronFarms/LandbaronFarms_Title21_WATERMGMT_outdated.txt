Water System Maintenance (§112.42) - Compliance Evidence Document
Date: October 09, 2025
Prepared by: Agricultural Quality and Compliance Team

Purpose
This document provides evidence that water system maintenance procedures are outdated and not aligned with current regulatory expectations under 21 CFR §112.42.

Evidence Summary
Requirement
Inspection Frequency
The SOP references annual inspection intervals but has not been updated since 2021; last inspection completed February 2022. Current risk-based guidance requires periodic verification aligned with water quality trends and system changes.

Requirement
Corrective Action Program
Legacy procedure does not include escalation for repeated deviations or linkage to water testing results (no integration with §112.44 outcomes).

Requirement
Change Control
No change history entries after 2022. Updates to sanitizer injection method (2024) are not reflected in the maintenance SOP.

Supporting Documentation
1. Water System Maintenance SOP – Rev 1.0 (2021).
2. Last Completed Inspection Report – Feb 2022.
3. Change Control Log – no entries since 2022.

Observations
* Procedures are outdated relative to current FSMA expectations.
* Lack of linkage between water testing and maintenance decisions reduces effectiveness.
* Recommend revising SOP to include risk-based inspection frequency and change control.
