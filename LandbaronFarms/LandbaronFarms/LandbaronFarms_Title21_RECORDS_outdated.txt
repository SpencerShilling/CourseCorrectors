Date: October 17, 2025
Prepared by: Agricultural Quality and Compliance Team

Purpose
This document identifies outdated recordkeeping requirements in policy documents compared to current expectations under 21 CFR §112.161.

Evidence Summary
Requirement
Retention Period
Policy states records kept for 1 year; §112.161(b) requires at least 2 years from the date the record was created (or until superseded).

Requirement
Electronic Records Validation
Electronic system validations last performed in 2020. No audit trails or metadata integrity checks documented since.

Requirement
Signature & Dating
Templates omit signer name field. §112.161(a)(4) requires records to be dated and signed by the person performing the activity.

Supporting Documentation
1. Record Control SOP – Rev 0.9 (2019).
2. IT Validation Report – 2020.
3. Record Templates – missing signature blocks.

Observations
* Record retention and validation requirements are outdated.
* Templates do not meet signature/dating rules in §112.161.
* Recommend updating SOP, revalidating electronic systems, and revising templates.
