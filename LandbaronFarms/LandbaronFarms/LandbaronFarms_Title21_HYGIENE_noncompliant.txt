Landbaron Farms
Worker Health & Hygiene (§112.31) - Compliance Evidence Document
Date: March 08, 2025
Prepared by: Agricultural Quality and Compliance Team

Purpose
This document provides evidence of deficiencies in Landbaron Farms' worker hygiene controls under 21 CFR §112.31–§112.33.

Evidence Summary
Requirement
Handwashing Facilities
Field zones B and C operated with only 1 functional handwash station each during peak harvest (requirement: stations placed for adequate access; §112.129(a)). Soap dispensers empty in 3 of 5 spot checks; single-use towels unavailable on 2 dates (July 12 and July 28, 2025).

Requirement
Hygiene Compliance Checks
Daily hygiene verification logs present for 34/60 days (57% completion). Observations of handwashing nonadherence in 6/20 randomly observed events.

Requirement
Contamination Risk
Environmental swab on cull table detected generic E. coli (12 CFU/100 cm2) post-cleaning, indicating ineffective sanitization practices.

Supporting Documentation
1. Field Hygiene Inspection Logs – Jun–Aug 2025 (incomplete).
2. Corrective Action Requests – Missing follow-up verification for July incidents.
3. Swab Test Results – Environmental E. coli detection reports.

Observations
* Hygiene controls are insufficient to ensure worker practices prevent contamination (§112.31).
* Verification frequency too low; corrective actions not consistently closed.
* Immediate remediation required: add stations, enforce soap/towel replenishment, increase verification to daily with supervisor sign-off.
