Zuul Tobacco Products Raw Material Certificate of Analysis Review Date: March 20, 2025 Prepared by: Product Quality and Regulatory Compliance Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for raw tobacco materials, as required under 21 CFR §1140.10(c). The absence of supplier-issued COAs prevents verification of ingredient purity, leaf grade, and moisture content for multiple production batches.
Evidence Summary Documentation Gaps — Five incoming raw tobacco shipments from February 2025 lacked corresponding Certificates of Analysis.
Supplier Response — Follow-up requests to two primary suppliers remain unanswered as of the audit date.
Batch Impact — Three production lots used uncertified raw material inputs, creating traceability and quality compliance risks.
Process Oversight — Procurement staff failed to document exceptions or initiate hold procedures for incomplete COA deliveries.
Corrective Actions — Procurement and Quality teams have been directed to suspend purchasing from nonresponsive suppliers pending documentation receipt.
Supporting Documentation
	1	Receiving Logs — Records of raw material intake without attached COAs.
	2	Supplier Correspondence — Email requests for missing certificates.
	3	Batch Production Logs — References to uncertified raw material usage.
	4	Corrective Action Plan — Memo directing supplier requalification.
Observations
	•	Missing supplier COAs impede material traceability and compliance verification.
	•	Procurement controls must enforce receipt verification before material release.
	•	Recommend periodic supplier audits to ensure certification integrity.
