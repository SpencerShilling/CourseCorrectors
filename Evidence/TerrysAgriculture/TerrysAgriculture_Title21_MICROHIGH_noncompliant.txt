Terry’s Agriculture Elevated Microbial Levels Audit Date: February 14, 2025 Prepared by: Agricultural Quality and Compliance Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of noncompliance with microbial water quality criteria under 21 CFR Part 112. Laboratory tests identified microbial contamination exceeding acceptable thresholds for irrigation water.
Evidence Summary Sampling Data — Test results from January 2025 revealed E. coli levels averaging 185 CFU per 100 mL across two irrigation sites, exceeding the regulatory geometric mean limit of 126 CFU.
Root Cause — Sediment buildup and poor filter maintenance were identified as contributing factors to contamination.
Impact — Affected crops were temporarily excluded from harvest until follow-up tests confirmed acceptable microbial levels.
Corrective Measures — Filtration systems flushed and chlorinated; new microbial sampling protocol introduced for weekly testing.
Supporting Documentation
	1	Laboratory Reports — January 2025 microbial data.
	2	Maintenance Logs — Records confirming filter cleaning.
	3	Corrective Action Plan — Emergency sanitation directive.
	4	Follow-Up Test Results — Verification of corrective success.
Observations
	•	Two irrigation sources exceeded microbial thresholds.
	•	Root cause linked to maintenance delays.
	•	Post-correction results confirmed restored compliance.
