Settlement Smashers Professional Services Charter Review Date: October 6, 2025 Prepared by: Professional Services Compliance and Operations Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of an outdated Professional Services Charter used to define the operational boundaries and engagement scope for consulting activities. The charter’s last revision predates key structural and compliance changes implemented in 2024.
Evidence Summary Charter Version — The current Professional Services Charter (Version 1.2, issued 2021) remains active despite multiple policy and compliance framework updates.
Scope Definitions — Engagement classifications within the existing charter do not reflect the expanded advisory service categories introduced in 2024.
Compliance Reference — New policy standards for client onboarding, data handling, and ethical review are not included in the current charter version.
Revision Efforts — A revised Charter (Version 2.0) is under draft review by the Legal and Compliance departments, with publication targeted for November 2025.
Training Impact — Consultants onboarded in 2025 received orientation materials referencing the outdated version of the charter.
Supporting Documentation
	1	Active Charter Version — Copy of current 2021 charter (v1.2).
	2	Draft Charter v2.0 — Working document under compliance review.
	3	Policy Update Notices — 2024 framework references.
	4	Onboarding Materials — Training packets referencing outdated charter.
Observations
	•	The current charter is outdated and misaligned with present policies.
	•	Training and compliance references must reflect updated engagement boundaries.
	•	Recommend expedited adoption of Version 2.0 before Q4 2025.
