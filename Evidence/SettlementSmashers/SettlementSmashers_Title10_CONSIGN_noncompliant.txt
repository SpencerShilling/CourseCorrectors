Settlement Smashers Missing Contract Sign-Off Audit Date: February 13, 2025 Prepared by: Professional Services Compliance and Operations Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of noncompliance with the internal contracting policy governing client engagement approvals. The audit identified multiple instances of unsigned or partially executed Master Service Agreements (MSAs) in violation of Settlement Smashers’ authorization protocols.
Evidence Summary Contract Review — Audit of 60 active client files found 8 engagements missing one or more required signatures on the MSAs.
Authorization Matrix — Three unsigned contracts exceeded the $250,000 approval threshold requiring Director-level authorization.
Document Management — The Consulting Engagement Management System (CEMS) lacked upload entries for scanned copies of the executed contracts.
Internal Controls — Contract tracking notifications were disabled in the CEMS workflow, preventing timely alerts for incomplete documentation.
Corrective Measures — All unsigned agreements were suspended pending execution and compliance verification as of February 2025.
