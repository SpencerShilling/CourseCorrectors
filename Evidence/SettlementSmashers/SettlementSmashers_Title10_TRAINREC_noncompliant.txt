Settlement Smashers Unverified Training Records Audit Date: May 3, 2025 Prepared by: Professional Services Compliance and Operations Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of noncompliance with internal ethics and professional conduct training requirements. The audit found that documentation for several consulting employees’ 2025 training completions was missing or unverifiable.
Evidence Summary Training Record Review — Training completion logs were unavailable for 14 consulting employees onboarded in Q1 2025.
Verification Issues — Digital signature verification failed for six records due to corrupted metadata files in the HR Learning Portal.
Policy Reference — Internal policy requires all consultants to complete annual ethics training before client assignment.
