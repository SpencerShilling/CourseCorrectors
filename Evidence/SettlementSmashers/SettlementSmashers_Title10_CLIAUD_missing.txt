Settlement Smashers Client Audit Record Review Date: September 3, 2025 Prepared by: Professional Services Compliance and Operations Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing client audit records required under Settlement Smashers’ quality assurance policy. The absence of completed audit reports limits the ability to confirm post-engagement review compliance.
Evidence Summary Audit Scope — Review of 20 client engagements found that five lacked completed post-project audit forms.
Recordkeeping — The Consulting Engagement Management System (CEMS) contained placeholders without attachments for completed audit summaries.
Policy Reference — Quality Assurance Policy §4.2 requires audit reports for all projects exceeding $100,000 in contract value.
Root Cause — Audit completion reminders were not triggered in CEMS due to inactive scheduling workflows.
Corrective Measures — System automation re-enabled in August 2025 with manual uploads required for missing audit files.

	2	QA Policy Manual — Excerpt defining audit requirement.
	3	Supervisor Follow-Up Emails — Requests for audit file submission.
	4	Corrective Plan — QA directive reinstating post-project audit verification.
Observations
	•	Missing audit files reduce verifiable oversight of client projects.
	•	CEMS automation was inactive for several months.
	•	Recommend monthly review of audit completion metrics.
