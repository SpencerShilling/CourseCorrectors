Photographic Evidence — Audit photographs confirmed lack of barriers or employee supervision near product racks.
Regulatory Reference — §1140.16(c) requires that no tobacco products be displayed for self-service access.
Follow-Up Actions — Corrective requests issued; two stores confirmed display removal within one week of audit notice.
