Tobacco Hut Junior Employee Training Log Audit Date: March 29, 2025 Prepared by: Retail Compliance and Audit Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing employee training documentation as required under 21 CFR §1140.14(c). The audit identified incomplete or unavailable training records for retail employees responsible for age-verification and restricted product sales.
Evidence Summary Training Documentation — Three regional stores did not produce training logs for their 2025 compliance sessions.
Attendance Verification — Exports from the Learning Management System (LMS) showed partial employee participation with missing timestamps and unverified completion records.
Follow-Up Requests — Multiple requests were sent to district managers for confirmation of training completion; only partial responses were received.
Training Records — No physical or digital certificates were available for new hires onboarded between January and March 2025.
Corrective Measures — Corporate compliance has initiated mandatory re-training and documentation uploads for all affected personnel.
Supporting Documentation
	1	LMS Export Files — Incomplete participation reports from Q1 2025.
	2	Email Requests — Audit correspondence with regional managers.
	3	Employee Roster — Store-level lists identifying unverified staff.
	4	Corporate Memo — Directive requiring updated documentation submission.
Observations
	•	Missing training evidence limits proof of compliance with §1140.14(c).
	•	Documentation inconsistencies indicate a lack of centralized record management.
	•	Recommend implementing automated completion tracking and centralized archival.
