Tobacco Hut Junior Distributor Certification Records Audit Date: July 17, 2025 Prepared by: Retail Compliance and Audit Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing distributor certification records required under 21 CFR §1140.14(a). The audit determined that several vendor agreements lacked documented acknowledgment of federal tobacco compliance obligations.
Evidence Summary Vendor Documentation — Certification files for four active distributors were not available in the corporate vendor management system.
Contract Review — Two existing agreements reference outdated compliance standards and omit clauses acknowledging FDA enforcement requirements.
Record Retention — Vendor documentation from 2023 and 2024 was not archived in accordance with internal recordkeeping policy.
Follow-Up Actions — Requests for updated certifications were sent to all active vendors; responses pending from two distributors.
Compliance Risk — Failure to maintain complete vendor certification files increases exposure to third-party compliance violations.
Supporting Documentation
	1	Vendor List — Active distributors as of July 2025.
	2	Procurement Requests — Pending certification documentation emails.
	3	Archived Contracts — Pre-2022 agreements lacking compliance references.
	4	Vendor Management Policy — Internal policy requiring biannual recertification.
Observations
	•	Missing distributor certifications violate vendor oversight provisions of §1140.14(a).
	•	Incomplete records prevent verification of supplier compliance.
	•	Recommend immediate follow-up with nonresponsive vendors and policy enforcement.
