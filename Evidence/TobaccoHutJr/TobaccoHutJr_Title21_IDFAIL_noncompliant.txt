Tobacco Hut Junior ID Verification Override Failures Date: March 4, 2025 Prepared by: Retail Compliance and Audit Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of noncompliance with the federal minimum-age sales requirement under 21 CFR §1140.14(b). The audit identified system control failures and manual overrides in Tobacco Hut Junior’s age-verification process that resulted in underage transactions.
Evidence Summary System Configuration — Multiple POS terminals were found with manual override capabilities active, allowing cashiers to process transactions without scanning customer IDs.
Transaction Analysis — Of 2,300 reviewed transactions, 54 lacked ID verification data. Ten transactions involved customers confirmed to be under the legal age of 21.
Employee Oversight — Interviews with staff revealed limited understanding of the system lockout function and inconsistent enforcement of verification procedures.
Violation Evidence — System metadata confirmed that manual overrides occurred primarily during high-volume evening shifts.
Corrective Actions — A compliance directive was issued to immediately disable all manual overrides and enforce employee retraining on ID-verification protocols.
