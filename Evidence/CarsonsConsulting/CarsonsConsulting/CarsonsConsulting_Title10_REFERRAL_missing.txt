Carson’s Consulting Presiding Officer Referral Documentation Audit Date: September 5, 2025 Prepared by: Legal Compliance and Administrative Oversight Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing referral documentation verifying case transmission to presiding officers under 10 CFR §13.27. Missing referral evidence prevents validation that settlements occurred prior to case referral.
Evidence Summary Referral Record Audit — Five settlement cases lacked referral confirmation forms or email correspondence verifying transfer to a presiding officer.
Regulatory Reference — No settlements may occur post-referral; missing documentation prevents confirmation of compliance with that restriction.
