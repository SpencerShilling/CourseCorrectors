Carson’s Consulting Settlement Correspondence Log Review Date: April 4, 2025 Prepared by: Legal Compliance and Administrative Oversight Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing settlement correspondence logs under 10 CFR Part 13. Missing logs prevent full verification of settlement activity, Attorney General notification timing, and procedural compliance.
Evidence Summary Case Review — Eight settlement case files lacked correspondence logs documenting communications between reviewing officials and the Attorney General.
System Audit — LDMS entries showed settlement agreements but no attached correspondence confirming notification or receipt.
Compliance Impact — Absence of these records hinders confirmation of settlement authorization and regulatory notification windows.
Remediation Plan — A new LDMS automation will generate correspondence log entries when Attorney General notifications are transmitted.
