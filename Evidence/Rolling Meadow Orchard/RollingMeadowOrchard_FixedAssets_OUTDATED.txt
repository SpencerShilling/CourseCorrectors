Date: October 22, 2025
Prepared by: Financial Compliance and Accounting Team

Purpose
This document provides evidence showing that RMO’s Fixed Asset Register used during initial FY2024 review was outdated and did not reflect recent changes in equipment additions and disposals.

Evidence Summary
Asset Additions Review —
A refrigeration unit (March 2024) and two pallet loaders (July 2024) were added during the fiscal year but not recorded in the register.

Asset Disposal Records —
Two tractors removed from service in January 2024 were not logged as disposals or adjusted for remaining depreciation.

Depreciation Schedule Review —
Depreciation calculations were based on pre-2023 schedules, despite updated policy changes effective January 2024.

Accuracy Assessment —
Outdated records result in misstated asset values and depreciation expense for FY2024.
