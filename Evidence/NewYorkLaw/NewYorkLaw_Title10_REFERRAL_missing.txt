New York Law Referral Documentation Audit Date: September 2, 2025 Prepared by: Legal Compliance and Administrative Oversight Team
Purpose This document provides evidence of missing referral documentation confirming whether case files were transferred to a presiding officer under 10 CFR §13.27. Missing referral records prevent verification that settlements were executed within the authorized procedural stage.
Evidence Summary Referral File Review — Nine cases lacked referral forms or correspondence confirming submission to or receipt by the presiding officer.
Procedural Reference — Per regulation, no settlements may occur after referral; therefore, missing referral confirmation limits the ability to validate compliance boundaries.
System Records — LDMS entries contained settlement documents but no referral correspondence files.
Root Cause — Administrative backlog during mid-year reorganization resulted in incomplete file transfers and index gaps.
Remediation Actions — Legal administrative staff are reconstructing referral documentation using archived email correspondence and scheduling a secondary compliance review.
