Date: January 11, 2025
Prepared by: Agricultural Quality and Compliance Team

Purpose
This document provides evidence related to Landbaron Farms' agricultural water quality program. The information below summarizes monitoring data and controls that demonstrate compliance with the microbial quality criteria in 21 CFR §112.44(a).

Evidence Summary
Requirement
Agricultural Water Quality Standard
Generic E. coli results for pre-harvest water (20-sample data set) indicate a geometric mean of 70 CFU/100 mL and an STV of 279 CFU/100 mL, both within required limits (geometric mean ≤126; STV ≤410; 21 CFR §112.44(a)). All samples were collected between March and August 2025 from surface and well sources per the farm's sampling plan.

Requirement
Postharvest Water Criterion
Postharvest flume and spray riser tests confirmed no detectable E. coli in 100 mL for sanitizing water, meeting §112.44(a)(2).

Requirement
Corrective Actions
No corrections were required during the period. Trend charts show seasonal variation but within control limits, with sanitation adjustments documented.

Supporting Documentation
1. Laboratory Certificates of Analysis (COA) – Q2–Q3 2025 microbial results.
2. Water Sampling Plan – Rev 2.1, including locations, frequency, and methods.
3. Sanitation Logs – Postharvest water sanitizer concentration checks and calibrations.

Observations
* All agricultural water results remained within regulatory thresholds.
* Sampling, analysis, and recordkeeping were complete and traceable.
* No corrective actions were necessary to maintain compliance.
