Requirement
Animal Intrusion Monitoring
Deer tracks and droppings observed July 7, 2025 in Block D within 5 meters of covered produce two days before harvest. No documented evaluation or flagging of affected rows prior to harvest.

Requirement
Corrective Actions
No corrective action or reinspection recorded. Harvest proceeded on July 9, 2025; no segregation or disposal of potentially contaminated produce was documented.

Requirement
Preventive Measures
No buffer zone markings or wildlife deterrents installed in the affected perimeter. Daily patrol logs missing for 9 of 14 days prior to harvest.

Supporting Documentation
1. Field Inspection Notes – July 2025.
2. Harvest Tickets & Lot Traceability – Block D.
3. Wildlife Patrol Logs – incomplete records.

Observations

* Lack of documented corrective action increased contamination risk.
* Immediate mitigation: implement buffer zones, complete patrol logs, document disposals/segregation when intrusion is detected.
