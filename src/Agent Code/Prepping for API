Transaction data, POS logs, and ID-verification records were reviewed.\nMethodology\nA random sample of 2,500 transactions was examined. Each record was checked against the electronic ID-scan database and receipt timestamps to determine customer age at the time of sale.\nAge-Verification System\nThe company employs an electronic ID-scanning system intended to flag underage customers. Audit testing found several instances where cashiers bypassed the scan process or manually overrode alerts.\nAudit Findings\nAudit records show that a portion of transactions were completed for customers younger than 21 years old. Specifically, 47 transactions (1.9%) of those reviewed involved purchasers aged 19 or 20. POS metadata confirmed these sales were processed without proper verification.\nDocumentation and Retention\nID-scan logs, POS records, and cashier override reports are maintained in the Retail Compliance Management System (RCMS). Records confirm missing verification entries for the underage transactions identified.\n\nSupporting Documentation\n1. POS Transaction Reports  Detailed sales data showing customer age, timestamp, and cashier ID.\n2. ID-Verification System Logs  System reports identifying manual overrides and skipped scans.\n3. Cashier Training Records  Documentation of employee training completion and gaps for certain staff.\n4. Audit Sampling Plan  Methodology outlining transaction selection and validation steps.\n5. Incident Summaries  Internal notes describing each underage-sale case reviewed by compliance staff.\n\nObservations\n* Several employees manually bypassed ID-scan prompts, resulting in sales to individuals under 21.\n* Stores with the highest frequency of underage sales lacked full enforcement of the electronic verification system.\n* Training and supervision documentation indicate inconsistent adherence to required verification procedures.\n* Audit evidence, transaction reports, and system logs have been archived in RCMS for follow-up review by senior compliance management.\n\nDocument Control\nDocument ID\nVersion\nEffective Date\nPrepared By\nReviewed By\nTHJ-AGE-AUD-EVD\n1.0\nOctober 22, 2025\nLauren M.

The information below summarizes inspection findings and analytical results that indicate non-compliance with established water quality and microbial safety parameters.\n\nEvidence Summary\nRequirement\nEvidence Description\nAgricultural Water Quality Standard\nRecent laboratory testing shows that agricultural water does not meet required microbial and chemical safety thresholds. Elevated levels of total coliform and nitrates were observed, exceeding both internal and regulatory limits.\nInspection and Maintenance\nAlthough inspection schedules were established, several inspection intervals were missed, and maintenance documentation is incomplete. Some irrigation systems showed evidence of unclean storage tanks and sediment buildup.\nRecordkeeping\nWater usage records are incomplete and inconsistently maintained. Several data entries in the Agricultural Water Management System are missing timestamps or validation signatures, limiting traceability of water sources.\nMicrobial Quality Criterion\nIrrigation and harvesting samples failed to meet Microbial Quality Criterion thresholds. Microbial analysis reports indicate elevated E. coli counts in multiple test samples collected between July and September 2025.\n\nSupporting Documentation\n1. Water Quality Test Reports  Laboratory analyses from Q2 and Q3 2025 indicating exceedances in nitrate and microbial levels.\n2. Inspection and Maintenance Logs  Partial logs showing irregular inspection dates and missing maintenance verification for irrigation systems.\n3. Water Usage Records  Incomplete data exports from the Agricultural Water Management System showing unrecorded usage periods.\n4. Microbial Testing Reports  Certificates from external laboratories confirming microbial counts above acceptable limits under the Microbial Quality Criterion.\n\nObservations\n* Water from multiple sources did not meet required microbial and chemical standards.\n* Maintenance and inspection lapses contributed to potential contamination risks.\n* Recordkeeping deficiencies reduced the ability to demonstrate consistent compliance.\n* Immediate corrective actions are required to mitigate contamination risks and restore compliance with agricultural water standards.\n\nDocument Control\nDocument ID\nVersion\nEffective Date\nPrepared By\nReviewed By\nLBF-AG-WTR-STD-EVD\n1.0\nOctober 22, 2025\nElaine Whitaker, Compliance Analyst\nRobert M.
