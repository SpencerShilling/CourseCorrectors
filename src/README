# Source Code Directory

This directory contains all source code modules for the Course Correctors AccureIQ Compliance Automation System.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a logical stage in the data pipeline — from ingestion to orchestration.

## Subdirectories
- **ingestion/** – Handles data input and schema validation.  
- **matching/** – Matches CFR updates to customers and evidence.  
- **checklist_api/** – Interfaces with the ComplianceAI checklist API.  
- **accureiq/** – Performs compliance evaluation and decision logic.  
- **storage/** – Stores results and traceability logs.  
- **notify/** – Generates and sends POC notifications.  
- **orchestration/** – Coordinates the full workflow pipeline.

All scripts in these folders should be modular, tested, and documented.
